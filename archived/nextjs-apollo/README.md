# BaseCMS Apollo GraphQL Client & HOC for NextJS

## Development
Anytime changes are made, you must rebuild the dist folder. From the monorepo root, run:
```
scripts/workspace.sh @parameter1/base-cms-nextjs-apollo run build
```
This will build both CommonJS and ES Module versions of the source using Rollup.
